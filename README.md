# 🧠 AI-Based Mental Health Risk Prediction using EEG & ECG Signals

An end-to-end AI-powered healthcare application that predicts mental health risk using multimodal EEG and ECG signals. The project combines advanced feature engineering, machine learning, explainable AI (SHAP), and a Flask-based web application to deliver personalized mental health risk assessment.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This project leverages physiological signals from the brain (EEG) and heart (ECG) to build an intelligent mental health risk prediction system. It extracts multimodal features, learns complex brain–heart interactions, and provides explainable predictions through SHAP visualizations.

The solution is divided into two phases:

- **Phase 1:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and explainability.
- **Phase 2:** Deployment of the trained model as an interactive Flask web application.
